This mod introduces an RPG-style class and leveling system where all monsters provide experience based on their health, defense, and damage stats. Your current level and progression is presented in a movable UI box. As you level, you unlock various bonuses and progress through three tiers of classes with several choices along the way.

A MAJOR overhaul is now underway. See the forums or discord for more details!


CHANGELOG:

===v2.0.0===

Revamp

===v1.3.13===

Revised Cleric/Saint descriptions. The auras were removed a while ago. Several new ACTIVE abilities have been added in their place. See the website for more details.

===v1.3.12===

Removed free Opener Attack on full-health targets.
Renamed Opener Attack to Assassinate.

===v1.3.11===

Applied orb xp fix to ascension and boss orbs

===v1.3.10===

Fixed multiplayer orb xp bug (no longer grants xp to all players)

===v1.3.9===

Disabled Ninja petal procs.
Built on latest tModLaoder 0.10.1.5

===v1.3.8===

Git Integration! You can now access downgrade through the Mod Browser.

===v1.3.7===

1. Bug Fix
* Fixed a bug that could prevent new and pre-mod characters from joining worlds

===v1.3.6===

1. Cleric/Saint Abilities (complete!)
* Sanctuary completely implemented
* Divine Intervention completely implemented
* Paragon/Renew completely implemented

2. Status System:
* added a custom status system so that effects will not need to take buff slots (Cleric/Saint effects are statuses; during reworks, all current mod buffs will become statuses)
* statuses do not show in the buff bar, but most will have visual effects
* I am open to suggestions on how best to display duration info if at all (currently not shown)
* added /expstatusmsg to toggle showing status gain/lose messages (defaults to on)

3. Misc:
* Headless Horseman is now counted as undead
* Optimizations for heavily populated servers and very low-spec systems

4. Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug that could prevent certain mod ability projectiles from spawning

===v1.3.5===

1. General:
* Updated to tModLoader v0.10.1.4

2. Cleric/Saint Abilities:
* implemented Cleanse, Cure, and Purify
Note: remaining abilities will be added throughout the week/weekend

3. Ability System:
* silence now prevents abilities

4. Other:
* added several more search terms to the undead list
* undead checking is now optimized for npc that have been checked before (should prevent slight delay when using heal on a large group)

===v1.3.4===

1. Cleric/Saint Rework (ongoing):
Goal: make the support playstyle more engaging/fun by introducing several active abilities to make up for the lack of support tools in vanilla
Cleric will be further reworked in v1.4 along with the rest of the classes (different stats, later tier 3, tweaks and balancing of abilities, etc.)
* removed the current auras from Cleric/Saint
* some abilities are now partially implemented, see doc linked on forum post for more info (remaining features will be added throughout the week)
Note: The cleric ability system is not representative of what other classes will receive. This is a support class with essentially no vanilla tools so it needs the most love. Most classes will have just two abilities (they will have similar upgrades that transform the skills as you progress).

2. Ability System:
* dust created on ability use now shows up for all clients in multiplayer
* added line of sight to cursor as an available check for any ability
* added /expabilityoverhead to toggle showing ability messages overhead or in the chat console (defaults to overhead)
* optimized code for abilities that need to find all valid targets in an area
* added checks to prevent non-pvp players from healing pvp players
* added syncing for long duration projectiles when a player joins in multiplayer

3. Balance:
* xp and ascension orb range reduced to half of what it was (5000 reduced to 2500)
* added an extra 5% flat chance to drop boss orbs in singleplayer (or when only one player is in a server)

4. Ascension Drop Change:
Drop rate will now increase based on how many of that specific monster have been farmed since the last time that that type of monster dropped an Ascension Orb. For example, a slime will have a higher chance to drop an Ascension Orb if many slimes have been slain since the last time a slime dropped an orb. Each type of monster is tracked separately and that monster's counter is reset when it drops an orb for anyone.
An optional kill counter has been added to the experience ui. Toggle with /expkillcount (defaults to OFF). Shows the counter for the most recently killed monster type only.

5. Other:
* Sync checks are now less frequent to see if that reduces multiplayer lag when running several mods on low-spec systems (checking if a resync is needed was changed from 250ms to 500ms)
* Archer's "arrow damage" renamed to "bow damage" (because it affects bows, not arrows)
* fixed typo in expmapauthcode

6. Bug Fixes:
* prevent multiplayer console error on player join (harmless bug)

===v1.3.3===

Cleric/Saint rework delayed again, but here are some more fixes/qol changes.

1.Ability System (still not in use):
* abilities now interrupt attacking (400 milliseconds)
* prevent use while dead
* various optimizations (mostly timing and syncing)
* renamed accept resurrection key to "Alternate Effects", will be used by a few abilities
* removed keys for the main key + modifier key control mode, the simpler system seems to be the clear best choice
* added generic visual upon using active ability, colour varies with class

2. Changes:
* Boss orb drop rate is significantly increased at low level
* merge xp messages that occur together in singleplayer similar to multiplayer
* reorganized the startup message and added more fields

3. New Features:
* added /expcd # to set threshold for showing cooldown messages (e.g., show if cooldown >5 seconds, set -1 to disable)
* added /expuibarcd to toggle  on/off cooldown bars in ui
* added /expuiinv to toggle always showing ui when viewing inventory (default to on)
NOTE: in the not too distant future, I will add a settings UI to replace all of these commands

4. Technical:
* even more optimizations, everything should be running buttery smooth

5. Bug Fixes:
* midas chance capped at 100%
* fixed display bug for dodge chance (due to a limitation, might show a bonus of 30% while still correctly applying a lower bonus such that dodge rate is not increased beyond 30% total)
* afk mode will no longer trigger upon entering a world (fixed timing initial value)
* fixed issue introduced by mana values exceeding 400
* fixed all orbs giving no xp in multiplayer

===v1.3.2===

1. Balance:
* Boss Orbs now grant no less than 0.5% of current level (then modified by exprate)
* Ascension Orb drop rate return to 0.7% on expert (same as v1.2.8), 0.6% on non-expert

2. Bug Fixes
* fixed a multiplayer bug that seemed to manifest differently for everyone (errors in console, event issues, loot issues, failed sync of non-existent character, etc)
* fixed minor issue with the experience bar and /expuibar command
* fixed xp required sometimes didn't show up on ui if you toggled /expuibar a few times
* SpriteBatch crash should be fixed (please let me know if otherwise)

3. Technical
* a few more optimizations, should run a little better

===v1.3.1===

* fixed multiplayer xp sync bug

===v1.3.0 (it's a big one!)===

1. Major Change To Settings:
Character-specific settings have been removed except the toggle for displaying experience gains. All of these are now map-specific settings. A single set of commands can adjust these settings in both singleplayer and multiplayer (requires expauth in multiplayer unless you disable this feature). You can use /help in-game to review these commands. The map settings include (a) experience rate, (b) level cap, (c) ignore class caps such as mana cost reduction limits, (d) a customizable damage reduction applied to all class bonuses, (e) no-authorization-needed mode, (f) death penalty, and (g) map tracing for debug. Death penalty is now based on percent of accumulated experience towards the next level rather than percent of experience needed for next level. This means that the overall penalty is reduced but the penalty is greatest when you're close to a level. Death penalty can now be adjusted (default is 10%, set 0% to completely disable). Death penalty no longer applies until level 10.

2. Changes To Level Cap Setting:
The level cap feature now only limits class bonuses (tooltip notes if you are capped). Your actual level can exceed this cap and you can continue to gain experience beyond the cap. The new default level cap is 100 instead of no cap (set 0 to disable). The maximum possible level is still 3000.

3.AFK Protection:
If you haven't moved, jumped, or clicked for 60 seconds then you will be protected from death penalties to experience but you will also be unable to gain experience. Type /expafk to toggle this feature on/off (client-side, saves to your character, on by default).

4. Changes To Boss/Ascension Orb Drops:
Boss and ascension orbs are now instanced drops so any that you see are just for you! Also, you are now qualified for an ascension orb if you are far away but had previously interacted with the npc (damage, debuff, were hit, etc). AFK players will not receive orb drops. You now receive messages for your own orb drops only (let me know if you want an option to disable these messages). Boss and Ascension Orbs can no longer be crafted into xp but are instead directly consumable.
The xp value boss orbs now scale with level up to five times the current value (10,000xp at level 100) but the drop rate is now dependant on the difficulty (xp) of the boss killed relative to the current value of the orb. This prevents farming low tier bosses for silly amounts of xp. Boss orbs have a minimum drop chance of 5% and a maximum of 50%. Ascension Orbs are now worth 1/3 as much as a boss orb and have a constant drop rate from all monsters. All orb drop rates are now higher in expert mode.

5. Other New Features:
* added hotkeys for future abilities (one main key plus a few modifier keys, customizable, note that tModLoader allows multiple functions to be be assigned to a single key)
* experience ui now also displays active ability cooldowns, the experience bar can be toggled with /expuibar and the whole ui can be toggled with /expui
* added /expsettings command to view current settings

6. Other Changes:
* experience gain message changed to overhead display, turned on by default for new characters (was off by default, use /expmsg to toggle back on)
* overall experience from eater of worlds should be more consistent (less dependant on order of body parts killed, based on vanilla stats)
* cleric abilities are usable but will not do anything yet

7. Bug Fixes:
* resolved an issue that prevented most messages from sending after v1.2.8
* added a workaround for a cosmetic dodge-related bug
* fixed a npc desync that could occur under rare circumstances
* eater of worlds can now drop boss orbs (each segment has 1/50 the normal chance)

8. Technical:
* experience now syncs in "chunks" in multiplayer (resolves a small bug, substantially reduces network load, and should help reduce the potential for desync)
* server is no longer spammed with expauth code every 2 minutes, now the code displays once at start and every time an auth-requiring command is rejected
* any desync in experience or settings should now automatically resolve within 20 seconds at most
* various performance improvements that should help low-spec computers and cases where a client is run on the same machine as the server
* character trace works again (my bad!)

* have Ascension and Boss orbs craft into Exp Orb 100s instead of 1s (adjust exchange at each tier to 100/200, 300/600, 500/1000, 1000/2000)

* fixed a bug that could prompt the "You have gained/lost x experience." message each time ANYONE gains experience in multiplayer
* Ascension Orb recipe: heart crystal + mana crystal + 20 gold/platinum bars
* can now gain experience and view experience bar without a token equipped
* can now craft Experience Orbs into x100, x1000, x10000, x100000, and x1000000 for faster command-free consumption (not consumed by /expuse)
* manual consumption of Experience Orbs is a faster animation

* reorganized packet sender functions (performance improvement + less likely to introduce bugs)

===v1.1.1===

* Ascension Orb drop rate increased to 1/150 (from 1/200)
* Ascension Orb and Boss Orb rate of exchange for experience now varies with current class Tier (125/250, 250/500, 500/1000, and then 1000/2000 at level 50+ of Tier III)

* timing converted from ticks to milliseconds, no longer affected by pausing time with HERO's mod
* assassin operner attack can trigger every 2000milliseconds (and on any hits aginst full-life targets)

* many optimizations and organizations (too many to list)
* server now handles the experience in multiplayer (so many internal changes)
* to prevent potential experience reset bugs, the server cannot change an experience value until the player's initial sync is complete. the initial sync should occur within 500 msec of connection and repeats until successful. if, somehow, the sync is not possible then a server-wide warning messages will be sent out each time the server tries and fails to alter your experience value. if this ever happens, relogging will probably fix whatever is happening (please also report it to me)
* memory usage should be around 0.5mb highers

===v1.0.4===
